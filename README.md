There are still a few things I would like to change. 
    1. Fix the sizing of the photos so they are all the same size.
    2. Show all the photos instead of them being cut off.
    3. Add the hogwarts banner at the top under the header? This is optional, and maybe I won't like it...
    4. Add a high score!
    5. Choose a way to win and have a notice come up when that happens saying something along the lines of "Congrats! You beat your previous high score".

Thank you for reading!
